## **Project Name:** File encryption and decryption using XOR

**Description:** <br>This programme follows a simple method of xor encryption, allowing you to read and easily encrypt/decrypt a readable file, and store the output in a file of your choice (preferably a .txt file).

**Installation & Usage:**<br>The source code (.cpp) as well as the executable (.exe) files can be downloaded. The .exe file can be run with the following screenshot showing an example of the applications:

  <li> This example used the application to decrypt the "message.xor" file. The file is located in the same root folder as the executable file, therefore, the full file path was note needed.</li>
  <li> The file "output.txt" was used to store the decrypted message. This file did not exist, therefore, the application automatically created it in the root folder.</li>
  <li> The Key("password") required to decrypt the message is: "RADIATION". When encrypting data, a KEY is used, and the same KEY must be used for decrypting as well.</li>
</ol>
  
 N.B. the "message.xor" file in this repository is an example of an encrypted message from the [2021 Garmin Puzzle challenge](https://www.garminpuzzle.co.za/).
